Lecture1 Summary

Python History:
1. Developed by Guido Van Possum in 1989
2. Named after British comedy group Monty Python

Widely used major release versions: 2.7 and 3.x

Why Python is popular:
1. Supports Multi-paradigm
2. Portable(cross platform). Its compiled + interpreted. 
   Write once run everywhere using PVM (Python Virtual Machine)
   hello.py ----(Compiled to create)---> hello.pyc. pyc is a pycode (similar to bytecode)
   hello.pyc is then interpreted by python interpreter to run on actual machine.
3. Prebuilt large collection of libraries
4. Smaller the amount of code compared to C/C++/Java
5. Open source

Python is widely used. Companies like Google, Youtube, DropBox, Cisco, IBM and NASA are using Python.
Python us used for:
1. Automation tasks
2. System Programming
3. Database programming
4. Internet Scripting
5. Game development
6. IOT etc.

First Program:
#!/usr/local/bin/python3.7
print("Hello Universe!!!")

Explanation:
line 1: #!/usr/local/bin/python3.7
	This is the “she bang” line. It tells the path of python interpreter which will be used to execute statements after this line.

line2: print("Hello Universe!!!")
print is inbuilt function to output the arguments on to console.

Notes:
1.  # - Single line comment
2. ’’’ ‘’’ OR “”” “”” is used for multiline comment.
3. Python is case-sensitive.
4. Editors for Python programming: vim, Notepad++, PyCharm, Eclipse (using PyDev plugin)
5. Pylint and pep8 tools are used for code formatting of python code. Pep8 is on the way of deprecation. Instead use pycodestyle.

Input acceptance:
On version 2.x, raw_input is the in-built function to accept input from console. On version 3.x, the function is input.
Input is stream of bytes. We can use function eval to evaluate the entered stream:
>>> x=eval(input("Enter String: "))
Enter String: "123"
>>> type(x)
<class 'str'>
>>> x=eval(input("Enter String: "))
Enter String: 123
>>> type(x)
<class 'int'>
