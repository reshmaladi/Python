Write a program to check weather given number is even or add without using arthmetic operator 

on add
off even 

Write a program to accept string from user and print counts of consonants of it.


Write a program to accept number and its bit number to trun off from the given number . Print number in decimal after it.
Ex. input =16 
bit postion is 5
10000

Write a program to accept number from user and check if it is divisible by 8 without using arithmetic operators

write a program to accept number from user and number of bits to turn on from given position 
OR  only shift
