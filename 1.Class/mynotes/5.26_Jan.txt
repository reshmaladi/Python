Accept two strings and 

srt1= input("enter string")
str2= input( "enter second string")
str1_part= str[:2]
str2_part= str[:2]
str1= str2_part + str1_part[:2]
str2= str1_part + str2_part[:2]

enumaration control : for loop
control : while and do_ while 

for <loop_variable> in <iterable_container> :
	<body for loop>
	
for x in range(10):
	print (x)

for x in range(10):
	print (x)
for x in "india":
	print (x)
	
do nothing loops\ time delay loops
c syntax:
for (i =0; i<10000 ; i++);

Python  syntax
for _ in range (10000):
  pass
  
_ is anonimous variable 


Write a program to accept integer from user and prints its table 

for x in range (1,11):
  print (x * 2)
  
  
 
Range is written as  range (10) the it act as end index
 but if we write as range(1, 10); 1 is start index , 10 is end index 
 range(1,10,2); 2 is stepping stage 
  
program to integer from user and print table from 2 to n 

no =  eval(input ("enter use from n "))
for x in range(2,no+1):
	for y in range(1,11):
		print (x  * y)


while contract

while <condition>:
 <body>

pre test 
post test 
mid test 


***************
Jump statements 
- break 
- return  : breaks current iteration
- continue : Skip current iteration

Break

while True:
	i =eval (input( "Enter"))
	if i == 10:
	 break 
	 print (i)
	 
Odd printing
i=0
while i<10:
 if(i%2==0):
    i+=1
    continue
 print (i)
 i+=1
 =====================
 Program 1:
 while True:
	i =eval (input( "Enter"))
	if i == 10:
	 break 
	 print (i)
else: 
	print("executed else")
Program 2:
i=0
while i<10:
 if(i%2==0):
    i+=1
    continue
    print (" not print")
 print (i)
 i+=1
else:
 print("Executed else ")
 
 in second program else part is getting printed
 if logical break is there else part 
else part can be applied to for loop too .

Write a program to accept number from user and find its factorial 
no =  eval(input ("enter use from n "))
#for i in range (no):
fact=1
for x in range (1, no+1):
	fact =fact* x
	print (fact)

Function

starts with " def"	


if (no==1):
	print (no)
	break
if (no ==0):
	print (no)
	break
	
	
Factorial program	
	def factorial(no):
	fact=1
	for x in range (1, no+1):
		fact =fact* x
	return fact
		
#no =  eval(input ("enter use from n "))
f= factorial(5)
print (f)
